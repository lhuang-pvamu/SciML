Welcome to SciML's documentation!
=================================


It is a repository to experiment Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) in simulating physical dynamics, understanding machine learning pros and cons in scientific computing, and discovering physical rules using the data-driven and physics-based method.

The fundamental crux of the project is to solve a variety of differential equations with machine learning.

We studied the following physical phenomenons:

1. Pendulum
2. Spring Mass
3. Wave Propagation
4. Poisson
5. Lorenz

with the following SciML models:
