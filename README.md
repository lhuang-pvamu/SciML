# Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)

It is a repository to experiment Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) in simulating physical dynamics, understanding machine learning pros and cons in scientific computing, and discovering physical rules using the data-driven and physics-based method.

The foundamental crux of the project is to solve a variety of differential equations with machine learning.


The code has the following structure:

## Physics
## Games
